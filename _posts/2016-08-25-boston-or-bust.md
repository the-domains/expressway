Boston or Bust

The road is veering and I am out of time.

It's already been too long it one place.

So many things left undone, words unsaid, places unvisited,

books unread, trails untraveled.

There is a big new trail, but far away.

I can be there soon.

And find new friends, read new books, speak the words, and 

find something that I wasn't even looking for.
